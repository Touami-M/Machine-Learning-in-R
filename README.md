# Machine-Learning-in-R
Some common Machine Learning algorithms and techniques applied using the R language.

Using common R datasets (also some imported from mlbench), to implement some of the most notorious machine learning algorthims and techniques on them, this includes data preprocessing, SVM, Neural Networks, Decision Trees, K-means clustering, Random Forests, Adaboost, PCA and Linear Regression.

The scripts also provide some insights such as execution time, performance, and accuracy and error measures.
